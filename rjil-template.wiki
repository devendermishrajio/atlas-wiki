= Templates =

== Aim ==

Cases where an outline file is required, it must be cleanly separated from the puppet code so that these template and code can be changed independently. It also automates the generation of file with some outlining in a clean way.

== What are in templates? ==

Templates are outline of files filled with some variable or action. Template files are in Embedded Ruby (.erb) format which contains ruby code inside. When '''template''' function is called, embedded ruby code insde the files are executed and results are printed in the file itself.

== Dependencies of Templates ==

No external dependency.

== What are the existing uses of templates in the code? ==
