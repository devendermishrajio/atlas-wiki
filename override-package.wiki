= Override packge =

This script generates package into new_repo directory as new_repo.tgz and debian files.

While installing package in a machine, new_repo directory is added as a source directory for package lookup with highest priority (so that package from other remote directories are not look-up). On running apt-get, it looks the package from the local directory and installs the required package.

== Dependencies ==

* repo, git
* repoconf_repo_source, repoconf_source_branch, repo_dir variables which comes from Jenkins.
* sync-repo.sh script: sync-repo.sh script is part of autobuild repository and is present inside autobuild/debian/sync-repo.sh.
* sbuild package: It is used to (re)build debian package from sources.

== Steps ==

This script works only when repoconf_repo_source variable is defined. This and other related variables are defined from jenkin jobs.

* It initialize the branch as defined repoconf_repo_source using repoconf_source_branch branch. Then branch is updated.
* sync-repo.sh script is called generate the change log and source package.
* sbuild is called to created the build.
* deb file is copied into new_repo.
* Create archives and compressed file into new_repo.
